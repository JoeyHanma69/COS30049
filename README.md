# Weather Report Prediction

This project provides weather report predictions based on historical data and includes a front-end for user interaction and a back-end for data processing. The AI model integrated into the back end provides predictions based on pre-trained machine learning algorithms.

## Requirements

### Front-End (React)

- **Node.js**: v14+ (for npm)
- **React**: v17+
- **Axios**: for API requests

### Back-End (FastAPI & Python)

- **Python**: v3.8+
- **FastAPI**: for handling API requests
- **Uvicorn**: ASGI server for serving FastAPI
- **scikit-learn**, **pandas**, **numpy**: for AI model processing and data handling

> **Note**: All required Python libraries for the back end are listed in `backend/requirements.txt`.

---

## Setup Instructions

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JoeyHanma69/Weather-Report-Prediction.git
cd Weather-Report-Prediction
```

### Back-End Setup

1. Navigate to the `backend` directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Front-End Setup

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install Node.js dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

---

## Running Instructions

### Back-End Server

1. Start the FastAPI server using Uvicorn:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```

2. Once started, the API documentation will be available at:
   - **Swagger UI**: [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)
   - **Redoc UI**: [http://localhost:8000/redoc](http://localhost:8000/redoc)

### Front-End Application

1. In a new terminal, navigate to the `frontend` directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Start the React development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. The application will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Configuration for AI Model Integration

### Preparing the Model

1. Ensure the model is saved in the `backend/models` directory with the necessary code to load and preprocess data.
   
2. Update `backend/main.py` to load and initialize the model on server startup if not done automatically.

### API Endpoints

1. **Prediction Endpoint**: The back end includes a `/predict` endpoint to send data for predictions.
   
   - **Endpoint URL**: `http://localhost:8000/predict`
   - **Method**: POST
   - **Data**: JSON object containing input features for the prediction model
   
   Example request:
   ```json
   {
       "temperature": 22,
       "humidity": 50,
       "wind_speed": 10
   }
   ```

2. Update the front end to send a POST request to the `/predict` endpoint using Axios or Fetch API.

### Additional Configurations

- **Environment Variables**: If your project requires sensitive information (e.g., API keys or database URLs), add these to environment files:
   - For back end: create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory.
   - For front end: create a `.env` file in the `frontend` directory with keys prefixed by `REACT_APP_` (e.g., `REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8000`).

- **Data Files**: Place any necessary data files in the `data` directory, and update paths in `backend/main.py` as needed.

---

## Notes

1. **Testing**: Ensure both front-end and back-end are running for the application to work as expected.
2. **Deployment**: For production, consider using Docker to containerize the front end and back end or deploying to a cloud service like Heroku, AWS, or Google Cloud.

This README should provide you with all the steps to set up, configure, and run your Weather Report Prediction project. Enjoy working on your project!



This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
